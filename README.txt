Regarding the old.py function:

The old.py is the version that I created. The specific algorithm (the astar function) is heavily influenced by https://gist.github.com/ryancollingwood/32446307e976a11a1185a5394d6657bc . The graphic implementation is completely original, written by me, Jonathan Lin. Everything is 100% original except for the specific astar function.

Depending on how powerful your computer is, I do not recommend adding a ton of obstacles between your start and finish.



Regarding the new.py function:
As of writing this README file, 7/16/2020, I have not created this file yet. It is likely to not be completely original though.
